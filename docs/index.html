Clinical presentation of the disease varies from asymptomatic or mild cold-like symptoms to severe pneumonia requiring ventilator support or multi-organ failure, and it remains a major challenge to uncover the immunological mechanisms underlying the diverse clinical presentation and course of COVID-19. Furthermore, it is largely unknown to what degree the host genome might contribute to the immune response in SARS-CoV-2 infection. We have applied whole genome sequencing in parallel with consecutive extensive immune phenotyping (10 color 7 tube flowcytometry per sample) and functional immune characterization (TruCulture technique, 5 stimuli, 9 cytokines per sample) assays in 100 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Denmark. The immune analyses were performed upon hospital admission, and hereafter weekly until discharge or death. Our hypothesis is that host genetics contribute to the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, and our primary aim is to identify genetic features that can predict immune phenotypes and function in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. A better understanding of the relationship between the host genome and the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 would not only help improve personalized risk assessment, care, and treatment of COVID-19 patients, but also provide helpful knowledge for development of future medical targets and vaccines as well as tools for treating and preventing other infectious diseases. We therefore pose the challenge here of mapping host genetics to personalized response profiles, i.e. measures of patient’s unique immune behavior. We provide additional data to model batch effects as well as in house methods making use of graph techniques to increase statistical power, but especially look for novel solutions from the community. An additional cohort of 100 will be collected and added to this dataset providing opportunity to test solutions.",secondary:"None"},figures:[],subsetAssociations:{filename: "subset.jpg",legend:"Three subsets linked by a pseudonymized patient identifier.",},version: { scores: "None", description: "None", questionnaire: "None", subsets: "None", synthetic: "None", },provenance: { template: { commit: "None", tag: "None", }, specification: { commit: "None", tag: "None", }, },categories:[{category:{
